# vs-code-settings

Here are my current VSCode settings. 

## Some questions
- Did I perfectly curate these? No, no I did not.
- Will you keep these up-to-date? When I think about it :) 
- Can you explain a particular setting? Maybe—I haven’t honestly looked through every line and some of them may no longer work if I've uninstalled extensions, etc.
